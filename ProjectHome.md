This is a set of matlab code designed to integrate data from limnological sensors and a GPS unit to aid in mapping studies on lakes. It includes real-time graphing and mapping to help in the data collection effort.

It currently supports both YSI and Hydrolab sondes and uses an inexpensive GPS receiver.

### Example Cruise ###
This cruise was done on [Lake Mendota](http://lakebase.gleon.org/lake?id=4432) in the summer of 2011. With the water scooping apparatus (shown below), this large spatial survey took a very short amount of time, around 1.5 hours.

The sampling apparatus uses the speed of the boat to force lakewater into a enclosed container containing sensors. Here you can see Erika affixing the container to the boat.

And here is the sampler in operation on Mendota.
